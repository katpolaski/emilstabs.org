B     B/F#
I am water
B     B/F#
Dancing in the light
B     B/F#
Shimmering by the sweeping shore
B         A        E                B
Moving in darkness with the setting sun

B     B/F#      2x

B     B/F#
In the afterglow
B     B/F#
Of divine mind
B     B/F#
A resonating tone
B     A        E             B
Beneath the waves calls me in my dreams

Hearts bend

Rise in fire and slip away

B     B/F#
I am singing now
B     B/F#
Over the fear
